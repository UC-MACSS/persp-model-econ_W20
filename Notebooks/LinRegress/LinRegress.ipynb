    "This Jupyter notebook is an adaptation of the QuantEcon Lecture, \"[Linear Regression in Python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/ols.html)\" by [Natasha Watkins](https://github.com/natashawatkins). The code in this Jupyter notebook was written using Python 3.7. It uses data files `maketable1.dta`, `maketable2.dta`, and `maketable4.dta` that are retrieved from the QuantEcon repository. For the code to run properly, you will either need to have access to the internet or you should have the data file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. Otherwise, you will have to change the respective lines of the code that read in the data to reflect the location of that data."
